# hecras_gama_coupling

The POC model for Gama and HEC-Ras coupling. Main feature includes Gama monitoring and time scalling the hydrological simulation and the impact of dynamic water level on agent mobility.

## Required plugins

The model requires to be loaded with the [Git version of Gama](https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/InstallingGitVersion) in order to use the two required plugins for pedestrian mobility (stand-by) and HEC-Ras coupling.

### Pedestrian plugin:

You need an access to the Escape private forge hosted at IDEES Rouen

### HEC-Ras coupling:

The plugin is [here](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.experimental/tree/master/ummisco.gama.extension.hecras)
